This song from The Amazing Spiderman 2 I think is one of the best songs from a movie soundtrack. It is also a very good workout song in my opinion. It is 12 minutes, and there are 3 different beat drops that make for perfect times to get a good set in. I personally think the second drop is the best, but they are all good.
