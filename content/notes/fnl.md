![Friday Night Lights](./images/fnl.jpg)
This picture shown above is by no means the best picture ever taken. You can see the top of someone's head creep into the bottom of the frame, and if you stare long enough, you can see that the picture is tilted in the horizontal direction. However, this is still probably my favorite picture that I have taken because it captures the full essence of one of my favorite times in my life: Friday Night Lights.
