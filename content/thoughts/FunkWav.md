Calvin Harris managed to capture summer in a bottle with this album. Every song on this album perfectly exudes the summer vibe. My favorites from the album are Slide, Rollin', and Prayers Up, but you can't go wrong with any of these songs. Soon, Calvin Harris will drop Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 2, and all I hope for is for it to give the same summer vibe as Volume 1 did...
