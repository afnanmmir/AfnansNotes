Welcome to my digital sanbox, a place for me to put notes on various topics I am trying to learn more about and document my thoughts on various topics. Notes will likely be on the topic of software, machine learning and systems (but other topics may be added if I gain new interests ðŸ™‚). Thoughts I have can be of any topic, from academic, to music, to sports, to people, and to everything else.


Feel free to search for a note by their titles or tags and have fun reading.

This is mainly a personal space for me to put down my thoughts and notes, but if you happen to stumble upon this site, I hope you find something interesting or useful.
